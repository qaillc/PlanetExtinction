# Planet Extinction

Extinction of our Planet

We have just completed our initial analysis for the PASQAL Quantum Computing Hackathon. If we continue as we are, the extinction of our planet is projected to occur in 20X7. It’s death by many cuts.



What number do you think "X" is?



There’s still much work to do, but wow... we really need to start working on solutions instead of assuming this is 1,000 years away.  



AI itself may not be the silver bullet, as the technology can be misused for harmful purposes and, in the long run, could potentially make things worse. 



Keep in mind this is just a theoretical study.  So please don't panic! But do recycle.
